# coding-practice

## Goal
The goal of this folder is to keep track of the daily coding practice and my coding interview prep.

## Source and File Structure
daily-coding: Questions I get from https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/. 

other folders are structured by topics, for example, Binary Search. These are the questions from Leetcode and HackerRank which I found representative and helpful.
