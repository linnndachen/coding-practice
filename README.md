# coding-practice

## Goal
The goal of this folder is to keep track of my daily coding practice and my coding interview prep. 

I solve at least one problem from Daily Coding Problem but sometimes, my knowledge is not sufficient to solve that problem yet. I would still write down the question so that I can come back to it later. I also pratice LeetCode and HackerRank almost daily. However, those platforms are very convenient to track my progress. Thus, they are not shown here.

## Source and File Structure
daily-coding: Questions I get from https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/. 

other folders are structured by topics, for example, Binary Search. These are the questions from Leetcode and HackerRank which I found representative and helpful.
